**A Phenomenological Correspondence Between Loop Quantum Gravity and Holographic Entropy**

---

## Overview

Kaelion proposes a correspondence equation that interpolates between Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and holographic entropy calculations:
```
S(A,I) = A/(4G) + α(λ)ln(A/l_P²) + β(λ) + γ(λ)(l_P²/A)
```

where the interpolation parameter λ ∈ [0,1] controls the transition:
- λ = 0: Pure LQG regime (α = -0.5)
- λ = 1: Pure holographic regime (α = -1.5)

**Key prediction:** α transitions from -0.5 to -1.5 during black hole evaporation. This is falsifiable and unique to Kaelion.

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundation

**Want to know WHY α(λ) = -0.5 - λ?**

See: **[kaelion-derivation](https://github.com/AsesorErick/kaelion-derivation)**

The derivation shows that λ emerges from:
1. Tensor network coarse-graining
2. Holographic quantum error correction

Both approaches independently give α(λ) = -0.5 - λ.
